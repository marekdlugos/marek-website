If you have not worked in sales before, here&amp;rsquo;s my short essay on why this is something you want to invest in straight from the beginning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ensuring you have the right foundations is what you can benefit from largely later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="why-should-i-even-care">Why should I even care?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Perhaps, you are a small team, but whether you want it or not (hopefully you want it) you have to communicate with (potential) customers, investors, and partners. The requirements to do this well grow quickly - first you want to start tracking the list of potential conversations you had, then you want to track the number of people who signed up for your free trial/tier, then you need to email them to let reengage them. Lastly, when they reach out to you, ideally you want to be able to keep track of that too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Year 2024 in Retrospective</title><link>https://www.marekdlugos.com/blog/year-2024-retrospective/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 08:08:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.marekdlugos.com/blog/year-2024-retrospective/</guid><description>&lt;p>Year 2024 started the best way possible. In the last 24 hours of 2023, I found myself on a plane, flying to a new continent and to a new country that I had never visited before: Brazil. Landing just 6 hours before NYE in an 11 million-person city, Sao Paolo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But first, how did I even get here?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="leaving-my-employer">Leaving my employer&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To find out how I ended up in Brazil we have to go back in time a little bit. In December of 2019 I moved to Switzerland to transition my career from product design to sales, hired by a local software company.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From No Running Experience to Half Marathon in Four Months</title><link>https://www.marekdlugos.com/blog/from-no-running-experience-to-half-marathon-in-just-four-months/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 08:08:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.marekdlugos.com/blog/from-no-running-experience-to-half-marathon-in-just-four-months/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was the guy who only ran in school because the PE teacher made us do it—not exactly a big fan. But I’ve always admired certain people around me for their athletic achievements. I thought those were not possible for me to achieve.&lt;/p>

 &lt;/div>

&lt;p>After avoiding any form of exercise for the past 2-3 years. Before, I used to basketball, do ballroom dancing, or go to the gym. The first two required others and facilities. With the gym, I just hate the fact that here in Europe it&amp;rsquo;s so rare to live in an apartment building that would have a gym. Otherwise, I just find it annoying and time-consuming to commute to the gym. Seeing a lot of my connections on socials running, I always wanted to see what and if I could achieve in this sport. Another advantage? The only thing I&amp;rsquo;d need were shoes. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if I am currently traveling or whether there&amp;rsquo;s a facility nearby. I could just get out there and explore.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Motivation to Write</title><link>https://www.marekdlugos.com/blog/motivation-to-write/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2024 19:12:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.marekdlugos.com/blog/motivation-to-write/</guid><description>&lt;p>For many years I enjoyed reading blogs, but was never brave enough to write one myself. I found the fact that the content becomes obsolete and stuff I write won&amp;rsquo;t be true anymore (or people will disagree with me) scary. But here I am today, in the VS Code typing in the first lines of what I am hoping will help me clear my head and form my thoughts better. Become more intimate with the world and people who want to tag along.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
