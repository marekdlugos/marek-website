| Written by Marek Dlugos</small><article><p>I was the guy who only ran in school because the PE teacher made us do it‚Äînot exactly a big fan. But I‚Äôve always admired certain people around me for their athletic achievements. I thought those are not possible for me to achieve.</p><p>After abandoning any sort of sport for the past 2-3 years, I finally thought to myself that something must change. Before, I&rsquo;d use to do basketball, ballroom dancing or go to the gym. For the first two, you always need to rely on other people and the facility. With the gym, I just hate the fact that here in Europe it&rsquo;s so rare to live in an apartment building that would have a gym. Otherwise, I just find it annoying and time-eating to commute to gym. Seeing a lot of my connections on socials running, I always wanted to see what and if I could achieve in this sport. Another advantage? The only thing I need are the shoes. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I am currently traveling or whether there&rsquo;s a facility near by or not. I could just get out there and explore.</p><p>So, in July, I started experimenting with running and set a goal I thought would be a real challenge: to run 5km (3.1 mi) non-stop by Christmas. I had six months to make it happen.</p><p>I started slow, with breaks during my workouts. My friends on Strava joked that I was just out for a walk since my pace was so slow. But step by step, I built up my speed and distance. After a few workouts, I surprised myself by reaching my ‚Äúmagic‚Äù distance of 5km (3.1 mi).</p><p>So, I kept going. Eventually, I ran 11km (6.8 mi). Don&rsquo;t ask me how, I don&rsquo;t know myself. I ran really slow, but I kept going. I was running circles in a park telling myself that I can do just one more and then one more. For the first time, I thought to myself, 11km (6.8 mi) is one fourth of a marathon. Could I take on a marathon someday? But then, knee pain kicked in. If there&rsquo;s an advice I can share and other people told me ‚Äî increase the distances you run gradually. I realized I was pushing too hard, too fast. So, I dialed it back and started checking out local races. Coincidentally, a half-marathon was coming up in my city.</p><p>Once I signed up and started training, a new goal crept in: Could I run this half-marathon in under two hours? At first, it felt impossible, just wishful thinking. Most (if not all) of my runs would be way way slower. One thing I heard about is that in order to run a longer distance, you don&rsquo;t actually need to run that distance before. Meaning - for instance for my half-marathon, the longest distance I ran before was only 17km (10.5 mi). I did that twice. The other thing I learned is that running slow is actually good. It&rsquo;s what then helps you run longer distances and improves your endurance. It&rsquo;s also often knows under the term &ldquo;Zone 2 Training&rdquo;. It all evolves around your heart rate and apparently was proven that if you do slow runs it has (possibly) the biggest positive impact. Then, on October 6, I started to believe that I might actually be able to run the half-marathon in under 2h, although that confidence faded with each difficult run. Even a few days before the race, I faced an intense hip pain, leaving me unsure if I could even finish, but I kept going.</p><p>I went as far as adjusting my entire daily routine to this half-marathon. Meaning, I was supposed to start the race at 9 am, so everyday in the morning, 1 week out, I would make sure to wake up before 7 am. Have breakfast at least 2 hours before I was supposed to start the run and then actually go out at 8h30 and do a quick run at 9 am to get my body used to that rhythm. To be able to wake up this early, I also adjusted my evening routine to go to bed early.</p><p>So on October 27 (Sunday), I stood on the starting line I turned what I earlier called a ‚Äúwishful thinking‚Äù into reality, finishing my first race in 1 hour and 52 minutes. I don&rsquo;t know how exactly, don&rsquo;t ask me. I made all the mistakes possible. They say that most people burn out because they go way too fast at the beginning of the race. I sprinted off and when I checked my watch later, I couldn&rsquo;t believe how fast I was. I knew I have to slow down and I did. What helped me mentally was clinging on someone in front of me who had a good pace. Heck, I even wrote down in what time do I have to run 3K, 5K, 8K, 11K, 15K&mldr; to achieve my goal of 2 hours. It did help me tremendously to save some time on each kilometer so I knew that even if things get unbearable towards the end, I will have time reserve. The view I had towards the end was both scary and exciting. More people cheering, the sun came out, but also a couple of people who were already in medical care. Laying on the ground, the staff would be lifting their legs to get the blood back to their heads. I was hoping this won&rsquo;t be me. My left calf started to feel odd and I knew that I can&rsquo;t push much more otherwise I might start getting cramps. Even my laces got loose towards the end and I had to stop to tie them not to fall on my face before the finish line.</p><p>But to pass that finish line was a magical feeling. The only 2 things I wish I would have done differently are 1/ to really enjoy those last few meters, perhaps even take a video (it wouldn&rsquo;t matter whether I came 30 seconds earlier or later) 2/and the second thing is just to look back after I crossed the finish line. Look back at the track, at the people and soak up the moment. Reflect back on how much it meant to me, and how much training I put into it. Speaking of training, I counted that I went roughly on 40 runs since I started my journey four months ago until now. That&rsquo;s about how many I can recommend if you&rsquo;d like to finish a race like this, and it&rsquo;s an amazing feeling that no one can take away from you.</p><p>I&rsquo;m sharing this because I‚Äôm genuinely surprised at how quickly my goals and mindset shifted‚Äîfrom hoping to run 5km by Christmas to knowing I‚Äôd run 21.1km by the end of October, with a time goal in mind. Hopefully this inspires you too, if running was something you were thinking about, but never got a courage to really go for it and give it a try.</p><p>The biggest lesson is that sometimes, we just have to give things a shot. Who knows‚Äîit might turn out easier than we thought. Onward and upward.</p></article></div></section></div></main><footer><div class="container mt-3 mb-4"><footer><section><div class=row><div class=col-md-7><small class=text-muted>Made in üá®üá≠ by Marek Dlugos</small></div><div class=col-md-5><div class=row><div class=col><small><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/marekdlugos/ class=text-decoration-none>LinkedIn</a></small></div><div class=col><small><a href=https://www.facebook.com/marek.dlugos class=text-decoration-none>Facebook</a></small></div><div class=col><small><a href=https://www.instagram.com/marekdlugos/ class=text-decoration-none>Instagram</a></small></div></div></div></div></section></footer></div></footer><div class=fixed-bottom><div class=progress-container><div class=progress-bar id=myBar></div></div></div><script src=../../js/bundle.min.js defer></script></body></html>
