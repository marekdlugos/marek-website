I hesitated a lot whether I should press publish on this self-pity piece and that people reading it might not find it appealing. Not only that but they would also see me as of lower value in their eyes. But I decided to roll with it anyway for two reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to share that life isn&amp;rsquo;t always this beautiful simple place where whatever we wants finds its way to us — it&amp;rsquo;s important to share that sometimes we feel down and it&amp;rsquo;s completely normal because we all were in this place. Secondly, this blog isn&amp;rsquo;t going to make me famous or anything. I write it to save some of my thoughts, feelings, and progress in life. So I am hoping that a couple of years later I will be able to re-read this article and laugh at this as I will either understand that there are bigger problems in life and/or be in a different, better spot.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
