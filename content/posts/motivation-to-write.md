# Motivation to write
Started writing on May 10, 2024.

For many years I enjoyed reading blogs, but never thought of writing one myself. I found the fact that the content becomes obsolete and stuff I write won't be true anymore (or people will disagree with them) scary. But here I am today, in the VS Code typing in the first lines of what I am hoping will help me clear my head and form my thoughts better. Become more intimate with the world and people who want to tag along.

Writing is great, it forces me to form my thoughts in a different way. While I could literally start writing in any tool and start publishing on any platform, there was this unexplainable feeling inside of me that I want to do it on my own, on my own blog, create my own platform. Probably not the smartest decision and likely a bias of a tech person.

I might be wrong, and people might disagree with me. However, no matter what, I enjoy the most exploring internet, people's stories, and reading their blogposts. Who knows, it might as well help and inspire other people.
