My story of getting a higher education is somewhat strange. I shot for the moon, got half-way through and in the end chose to stay on the ground. Which in my eyes turned out to be the best possible decision. 

What do I mean?

I come from humble background. Most of my peers at high school either did not pursue university or pursued universities that were within a radius of 1-2 hours of commute. I saw things differently. Maybe it was because thanks to the internet I was able to virtually hang out with people who wanted more and got more out of life. They told me about an option to apply to the best UK universities. An option that I would not know of otherwise.

Applying to the top UK universities isn't any magic. The way I remember it, the most difficult part really was to write an outstanding so called "personal statement". An essay that's about 1 page long and summarizes your motivations and why are you so outstanding that they should admit you. With the same level or importance you should ensure you graduate with the best grades possible. Luckily at my high school this was an achievable task and I have never had issues doing that.

### Shooting for the moon

Applying to the universities in the UK gives you an option to apply for up to five universities. I chose a variety, but among those that are worth mentioning were University of Cambridge, Imprerial College London, and University College London.

Interestingly enough, University of Cambridge invited me over for interviews which was part of the normal admission process. I could not believe it and could not sleep at night. A guy from a small town in the east of Slovakia should travel to Cambridge to show whether he's worthy to study at Cambridge? That can't go well - and I was partially right. My Computer Science interview went well and I actually exceeded the interviewers expectations. On the other hand, at my mathematics interview I was too slow and that was the reason why I got rejected in the end.

They did invite me for interviews to Imperial College London too, but those I failed miserably, too. The problems I was tasked to solve were too abstract and too logical which was never my strong suit unfortunately. But my wise and genius friends claim it's a skill that can be learned!

### Getting half-way

Just when I would think - what a stupid idea, I will never make it to the best universities in the UK, the University College London gave me an offer (in other words said that if I graduate with good grades - I am admitted). At the time when I am writing this article, University College London is among the best universities in the world.

I thought about it long and hard. The program I was admitted to was tasked to combine information technologies together with business. But as an Eastern European kid I thought to myself - combining business and information technologies at the undergraduate level? Perhaps I would be better off studying pure IT at the undergrad and pursue a mastere degree in Business Administration later.

So that's what I did. 

(Well, kind of, I am still not enrolled in any MBA program.)

### Staying on the ground

As a backup option if everything will go wrong, I also applied for Czech Technical University in Prague and got admitted. Czech Technical University has an excellent reputation and is one of the best universities in... Czech Republic. But no one would probably know because the university is not as prestigous as the other names you read above. 

I opted for what seemed to me like the "least-best" option, but it had its advandatages too. One of the aspects I haven't touched on is that studying in the UK can get really pricey. At the time I was applying any student from EU would spend roughly 11,000 US dollars in tuition annually. On top, you need to count the living expenses in London. Down the line, I would have graduate with an undergraduate degree and an enormous student debt (I know it's still a fraction from what they are used to in the US). But the education within the rest of the EU was free to me and Prague is a true gem when it comes to living expenses (and lively tech scene!).

### So why the best decision?

As I got settled in my Software Engineering program the first thing I have done was finding a part-time job. It seemed natural to me. It is something I always dreamt about - when I will be at uni, finally people will employ me and take me more seriously. Not like back when I was still freelancing out of my high school dorm. One thing I did not take into consideration is that many of my older friends who worked a part-time job during university did not study Computer Science / Software Engineering. These programs can get truly hardcore and on thing I learned way too late is that they do require your full attention. If there's only one thing I could done differently looking back at my university studies, it would be not taking on any jobs. Just fully focusing on studying and expanding my knowledge. Why?

Putting many hours into jobs (sometimes almost what would be a full-time committment) was later reflected on my performance at school. For instance, in the first semester we had discrete mathematics, which I failed. In the second semester we had linear algebra (another branch of mathematics) which I failed too. Will I be a university dropout? It was modern and somewhat praised back then. Zukerberg, Gates, and others dropped out. Mentioning those names people often forget to mention that they dropped out of Ivy League universities.

It was about the time when I received this newsletter from our school mentioning that they are looking for students for a semester abroad in South Korea. I have never been to South Korea, and it seemed somewhat like a fairytale to me to go study there. But hey, I thought to myself if I am supposed to drop out now, wouldn't it be better to drop out after I come back from South Korea?

So I have gone to the office of the lady that was responsible for this, we chatted and she promised to look into my profile and get back to me. Next thing I know I was selected!

#### Korea

During my time in Korea I studied at Sungkyunkwan University. The university had two campuses and I was located about an hour from the city center in the town called Suwon. While the university seemed to offer a lot of amennities, many of them were inaccessible to me because of the language barrier. I would say that this was the biggest factor of how I remember my time in Korea. It was difficult to walk on a street and spark a conversation with a stranger. Heck, sometimes it was even difficult to understand the professors during the lessons. Many of us also took Korean language course and while I don't remember much more than saying "beer" in Korean, the whole experience was a great introduction to Asian cultures.

I remember a couple of notable trips across the country both with friends and school. The way I recall the weather in Korea between September and December is mostly foggy though without much sun light that certainly had impact on my moods.

Funny story is that as I was trying to find classes I could take, not satisfied with those where I could barely understand the English that was spoken in them or those that claimed to be in English, but were in Korean down the line, I was walking in a corridor, passing a class with wide open door. I passed the door when I realized that the class is taught in English. Not any English, but an American English that's really easy to understand and follow. So I went back, entered the class and sat down. As I followed the presentation in front of me I have noticed I have seen this before. It turned out to be the discrete mathematics class I failed before at my alma mater. After the class I spoke to the professor and immediatelly signed up. End of the story? I passed.

#### Israel

During my time in Israel I studied at the Tel Aviv University.

#### Hong Kong

During my time in Israel I studied at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

#### Argentina

During my time in Israel I studied at the University of Buenos Aires.
