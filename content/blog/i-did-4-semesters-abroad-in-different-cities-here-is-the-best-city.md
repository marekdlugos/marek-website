My story to get a higher education is somewhat strange. I shot for the moon, got half-way through and in the end chose to stay on the ground. Which in my eyes turned out to be the best possible decision. What do I mean?

I come from humble background. Most of my peers at high school either did not pursue university or pursued universities that were within a radius of 1-2 hours of commute. I saw things differently. Maybe it was because thanks to internet I was able to virtually hang out with people who wanted more and got more out of life. They told me about an option to apply to the best UK universities. An option that I would otherwise consider impossible.

Applying to the top UK universities isn't any magic. The way I remember it, the most difficult part really was to write an outstanding so called "personal statement". An essay that's about 1 page long and summarizes your motivations, motives, and why are you so outstanding that they should admit you. With the same level or importance you should ensure you graduate with the best grades which however at my high school was an achievable task and I have never had issues doing that.

## Shooting for the moon

Applying to the universities in the UK gives you an option to apply for up to five universities. I chose a variety, but among those that are worth mentioning were University of Cambridge, Imprerial College London, and University College London.

Interestingly enough, University of Cambridge invited me over for interviews which was part of the normal admission process. I could not believe and could not sleep at night. A guy from a small town in the east of Slovakia should travel to Cambridge to show whether he's worthy to study at Cambridge? That can't go well - and I was partially right. My Computer Science interview went well and I actually exceeded the interviewers expectations. On the other hand, at my mathematics interview I was too slow and that was the reason why I got rejected in the end.

They did invite me for interviews to Imperial College London too, but those I failed miserably, too. The problems I was tasked to solve were too abstract and too logical.

## Getting half-way

Just when I would think - what a stupid idea, I will never make it to the best universities in the UK, the University College London gave me an offer (in other words said that if I graduate with good grades - I am admitted). At the time when I am writing this article, University College London is among the best universities in the world.

I thought about it long and hard. The program I was admitted to was tasked to combine information technologies together with business. But as an Eastern European kid I thought to myself - combining business and information technologies at the undergraduate level? Perhaps you would be better off studying pure IT at the undergrad and the pursue an MBA later.

So that's what I did.

## Staying on the ground

As a backup option if everything will go wrong, I also applied for Czech Technical University in Prague and got admitted. Czech Technical University has an excellent reputation and is one of the best universities in... Czech Republic. But no one would probably know because the university is not as prestigous as the other names you read above. 

I opted for what seemed to me like the lowest option, but it had its advandatages too. One of the aspects I haven't touched on is that studying in the UK can get really pricey. At the time I was applying any student from EU would spend roughly 11,000 US dollars in tuition annually. On top, you need to count the living expenses in London. Down the line, I would have graduate with an undergraduate degree and an enormous student debt (I know it's still a fraction from what they are used to in the US). But the education within the EU was free to me and Prague is a true gem when it comes to living expenses.
