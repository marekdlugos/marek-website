# Introduction

It's funny how when I tell people I travel for a longer period of time with one backpack only, people have a hard time to comprehend that while it seems incredibly easy to me.

A couple of years ago, I kindly asked my friends to take two of my big suitcases from South Korea to Europe for me, while I embarked on a [2 month long adventure traveling through South East Asia](TBC) on my own with a tiny Shopify backpack. Half of the space of it was taken by my big-ass DSLR camera, leaving not as much space for my stuff. 

@TODO: Include somewhere my travel itinerary.

@TODO: Advantage of carry-on only.

The reason why I am mentioning it is that traveling South East Asia with a small backpack was a piece of cake in comparison to my most recent travel across Latin America. The weather across South East Asia was more or less the same. Hot, humid, with rain here and there. Thus, packing for such a trip, I was fine with a couple of tees, two pairs of shorts and swim shorts.

Embarking on this new adventure that was supposed to last twice the time was a whole new challenge. The destinations and the weather changing from freezing cold mountains to sweating on the beach, I decided to share the way I decided to approach it and possibly inspire others.

# The backpack

The way I thought before leaving home was that I will likely spend a lot of time carrying a backpack on my back so I might as well get a good one, but I couldn't decide which one! Weirdly, the offer is so much different in Europe than it is in the US and the prices range from $70 to $400.

I nailed my research down to four pieces:
- Decathlon's Forclaz Travel 500 Organizer backpack for $70.
- Ospray Farpoint 40 for about $150.
- Ospray Farpoint 55 for about $200.
- tomtoc Navigator-T66 Travel Laptop Backpack 40L for $80.

Having them all delivered to my home, it was *incredible* to feel the price difference touching the materials they were made of. While I loved the organizing pockets of the Decathlon's Forclaz backpack, the built quality seemed really low compared to Ospray bags. The same went for tomtoc backpack. The built quality of Ospray backpacks (and I assume any other high-end backpacks) was clearly outstanding and really swayed my decision towards them.

Narrowing it down to the two Ospray backpacks, I saw people online switching from the 55 version to the 40 version, however, even after this trip I would not do the same. Unfortunately, they both have their pros and cons. The catch is that the 55 version comes with two backpacks that can be attached to each other if needed. A larger backpack and a small day pack. That's the feature I loved about this investment the most honestly. The ability to leave most of my stuff behind or not have to unpack the backpack while going on a shorter day trip was how I operated most of the times. Taking only the smaller day pack with me on hikes or using smaller backpack for the things I want to keep close to me (e.g. on the plane where I would stove the larger one into the overhead compartment while the smaller one could easy fit under the seat in front of me). The only big disadvantage I see is the lack of the laptop compartment in the bigger back. Because if I'd like to travel somewhere where I don't need as much stuff with me, I would basically be forced to take the smaller day pack with me too to pack my laptop.

# What did I need to pack for

A freezing cold weather all the way down at the end of the world in Ushuaia, Argentina, but also sweating hot beaches in Caribbean.

# What was in my backpack

First of all, I got a bunch of packing cubes from China, but only really used three to organize my stuff. On top, my backpack offered a couple of compartments for smaller stuff.

Here's my high-level organization:
- A packing cube for all the t-shirts.
- A packing cube for all my underwear and socks.
- A packing cube for all the other clothes. Think swim shorts, a towel, shorts, pants, you name it.
- A side-pocket in my backpack for all the cables and small tech gadgets (an external drive).
- A side-pocket in my backpack with a bag for all the pills/medicine in case I would need it.
- A pocket for my laptop in the smaller day pack.
- A pocket for things that I wanted easily accessible in the smaller day pack (for sunglasses, a passport, a pen...)

## How many clothes did I take?

Everyday wear:
- X number of t-shirts
- X pieces of underwear
- X long-socks for colder weather and X pairs of ankle socks
- A pair of flip-flops and a pair of shoes that seem fine for both hiking and everyday use

My rational was simple. Every week or slightly more (depending on the weather, how much I sweat, etc.) do the laundry wherever I was. I was unsure whether it would be as easy to find these places as it was in the South East Asia, but gladly it was! 

Clothes specific for cold weather:
- 1x zip-up hoodie
- 1x waterproof and windbreaker jacket
- 1x mid-warm gloves
- 1x warm hat
- 1x long pants (chinos)
- 1x long pants (for hiking)

Electronics:
- 1x laptop + charger
- 1x travel adapter
- 1x external drive + connecting cable
- 1x phone charger

All the other stuff I had on me:
- 1x tooth brush, tooth paste, and interdental brush
- 1x deodorant
- 1x nail scissors - a weird thing happened here. On this trip, I took in total over [25 flights](flight-radar-link). When I was like 15 flights in, at the airport security in Colombia, I was forced to throw these away because apparently I was not allowed to take them with me. However, from what I know, as long as the sharp objects are no longer than 6 centimeters, it should all be fine.
- 1x 
- *A bag with emergency medicine* - including simple band-aids. This was helpful, luckily I did not get incredibly sick during my time abroad. However, there seemed to be way too many pharmacies all over most of the places I traveled to. That made me think that even if I would skip this item completely it wouldn't make much difference.

With all of the above, I did not feel like I miss anything during my travels. Some time ago I have heard a good rule (which I broke myself too):
> "If you doubt whether you should pack something, then you likely don't need it and won't use it.
Turned out to be true for a couple of items I packed.

Things I would NOT take on such a trip with me again:
- 1x drone, and controller
