      <h4 class="mb-1">Hire Me as an Intern</h4>
      <p>At the end of high school, I created a website to express my desire to find a summer internship abroad. The website gained massive attention, becoming the #1 post on Y Combinator's Hacker News and attracting over 30,000 visitors in a single day. It also brought me more than 150 emails from around the world and significant media coverage.</p>
      <p>This project ultimately helped me secure an internship in Hawaii and another at Shopify in Canada.</p>

      <h4 class="mb-1">Designer Meetups</h4>
      <p>Organized designer meetups in Prague ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¿ and Ottawa ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦â€”two cities where I used to live. I managed every aspect of these events, including sourcing speakers, handling communication and promotion, and overseeing the execution.</p>
      <p>In total, the meetups were attended by over 300 designers. For the event in Ottawa, I was fortunate to assemble a team of 10 incredible individuals who contributed their expertise to make it a success.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h4 class="mb-1">SpotMe Prospecting Tool</h4>
      <p>A simple JavaScript tool during my time at SpotMe that enabled sales representatives to generate mockups of our product with a prospect's branding. This tool made the process 10 times faster than before.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h4 class="mb-1">Wikidome</h4>
      <p>For my bachelor's thesis, I set out to create a better, modern, and easy-to-maintain enterprise wiki using Ruby on Rails and other modern web technologies.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h4 class="mb-1">I Wanna Join Intercom</h4>
      <p>As a spin-off of the "Hire Me as an Intern" project, I created a version specifically targeting Intercom. While this project also gained popularity, it ultimately wasnâ€™t enough to secure me an internship there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h4 class="mb-1">DNS Discovery Service</h4>
      <p>As part of a university team project, I collaborated with a company seeking a solution for their DNS management. I developed an application to manage DNS records in a database, built a REST API using the Spring framework as a Java EE application, and created a frontend with AngularJS.</p>

    <div class="col-md-6">
      <h4 class="mb-1">Upload.it</h4>
      <p>I came up with the idea to create a web application using PHP to simplify the process of uploading school assessments for students, while making it more centralized and efficient for teachers.</p>

      <h4 class="mb-1">High School Website</h4>
      <p>I took the initiative to manage the redesign of my former high schoolâ€™s 15-year-old website, which, according to rankings, is one of the best high schools in the country. The redesign has now been live for over 10 years.</p>
      <p>Fun fact: I was once at a bookstore, picked a random book in the marketing section, and opened it to a page that featured a screenshot of my redesign.</p>
