      <h3>Take Me as an Intern</h3>
      <small>Jun 2016 — Oct 2016</small>
      <p>During the 4 months gap between graduating high school and starting of university I wanted to be an intern so I
        made one-page site describing my skills and how can I contribute to the business. The site made it as #1 on YC Hacker
        News. Had over 30k visitors in one night and get huge media attention all around the world. Brought me over 150 emails
        and secured job in Hawaii and later on an internship in Canada.</p>

      <h3>Host me in California</h3>
      <small>Jun 2016 — Oct 2016</small>
      <p>High-quality education abroad has been my aim for a long time, which is why I came up with hostmeinca.com when I was
      16yo. In short time, this website became #1 on Y Combinator Hacker News. I got 30k visitors in one night, media
      attention all around the world and was even invited to talk at TEDx. Despite this success, I have not managed to secure
      sufficient funding to study & host family in California.</p>
